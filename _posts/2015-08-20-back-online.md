Today I am bringing my blog back.
It has been a while since I wrote something, but also a while that I have been looking to share some cool stuff too.

# What changes

I am changing my **domain name**. I am a bit ashamed to say it, but I couldn't figure out how to transfer my previous domain name from [OVH](http://www.ovh.com) (dear, the OVH manager interface is pure crap) to [Gandi](http://www.gandi.net), so I took the stupid decision to wait for that domain name to expire so I could buy it back from Gandi. Go figure, as soon as the domain name expired, it was bought by some Russian... Or at least that's what the WHOIS suggests.

I won't be linking to it, because since I don't control it anymore I don't want search engines to link it too deeply with me, but if you want to take a look at it the address is my first name dash my last name dot info. It feels a bit scary, because who knows what his/their motivation is, but for now they just serve a static version of my previous blog, with no ads. I know my tutorials were generating some respectable traffic, so I hope they are not going to use that fact to serve ads or sell crap, especially since the domain name contains my name. We'll see.
My new domain name is [nicola.je](http://nicola.je), it stands for **Nicola** **Je**remy. This time I will be separating my portfolio, which lies at [jeremy-nicola.com](http://jeremy-nicola.com), and my blog, which is found here.

I am also moving from [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org) to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), and from [OVH hosting](http://www.ovh.com) to [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/).
Wordpress is really great, but I always felt like it was too much for my needs. The only dynamic part of my website are the comments and the contact form, so I don't need a full php powered [CMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system). Moreover, I didn't like having my articles in a MySQL soup. I want to be able to edit my articles offline, with a simple text editor.

[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) is a static website generator written in Ruby. It integrates well with Github pages, and is really simple to use. I use the nice [Feeling Responsive](https://github.com/Phlow/feeling-responsive) theme.
As a bonus, I am starting a [Github streak challenge](https://ryanseys.com/blog/177-days-of-github/) with a friend of mine, so it should add some motivation to keep this blog up to date.

I will start by moving the old posts to this blog, and then gradually start to post new things.

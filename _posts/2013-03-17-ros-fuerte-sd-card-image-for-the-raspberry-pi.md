**Edit 10 april 2013:** As Paul let us know in the comments, it is now possible to install ROS Groovy from binary packages on Raspbian following the instructions in on the [ROS website](http://www.ros.org/wiki/groovy/Installation/Raspbian) ! Finally, there is no more need for pre-installed SD Card images =)
{: .notice-info}

Hello everybody,

I am moving to Brazil for the next 6months for my [Master Thesis](https://github.com/nicolaje/reliable-slam). I will not bring my Raspberry with me, so I won't be able to build new SD Card images for Raspbian & ROS until september.

You can find my last SD Card image directly downloadable now [<s>here</s>]() (EDIT: not available anymore, see the notice at the begining !).

I am not using BitTorrent anymore, I was just using it to monitor the number of times the image was going to be downloaded.

Good news, the image has been downloaded 116 times (that means more than 87GB uploaded!), and my posts on ROS Fuerte & Raspberry Pi generated more than 5000 views (!!) as I am writing this post.

It may not seem like big numbers, but it is far more than what I expected. For me it also definitively proves that there is a strong interest in getting ROS easily installed on the Raspberry Pi, which in turn means the Roboticist community is interested in the Raspberry Pi (for those who still had doubts...).

Let's hope we will have pre-built Debian packages to install ROS on the Pi some days...

Anyway, by then if you want to build your own SD Card image, it is easier now as there are detailed instructions on the ROS Wiki to build ROS Groovy on Raspbian ! Using my tutorial on distributed cross-compilation for the Raspberry Pi, it should be a piece of cake to build your own image! ;). But still, if you have troubles to build it, of course feel free to ask questions in the comments (not via the contact interface please, so that everyone can benefit  from your problem and its solution)!

Cheers,

Jeremy
